        "How I Caught a Malicious Upwork Test Project Before It Did Damage",
      blogContent: `
                    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I received a "test project" via Upwork that contained obfuscated malicious code. I caught it early, didn't run it, and safely cleaned up my system. Here's how I handled it and how you can protect yourself too.</p>

                <h2>üö© The Red Flags</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Client sent a GitHub repo with vague instructions: "Just run the project and let me know once it's working."</li>
                  <li>Package list included unusual and deprecated packages like <code>request</code>, <code>execp</code>, and <code>fs</code>.</li>
                  <li>A file deep in the backend code had large chunks of obfuscated JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>üß† What I Did Immediately</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Cloned the repo ‚Äî but <strong>did not run</strong> it blindly.</li>
                  <li>Inspected <code>package.json</code> and removed any suspicious dependencies.</li>
                  <li>Manually opened backend files and spotted base64-encoded strings, system calls, and encoded HTTP requests.</li>
                  <li>Used <code>grep</code> to scan for keywords like <code>child_process</code>, <code>exec</code>, and <code>request</code>.</li>
                  <li>Client blocked me on Upwork right after I asked for clarity ‚Äî which confirmed the suspicion.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>üßπ How I Cleaned It Up</h2>
                  <p>
                    -&gt; npm cache clean --force
                  </p>          
                   <p>
                    -&gt; rm -rf ~/.npm
                  </p>       
                <p>This cleared my system‚Äôs npm cache to make sure no malicious packages stayed behind. I also deleted the entire project directory.</p>

                <h2>üîê Lessons for Every Developer</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Always audit a test repo before running it</strong> ‚Äî especially from unknown clients.</li>
                  <li>If you see encoded strings, obfuscated loops, or unexpected network calls ‚Äî be suspicious.</li>
                  <li><strong>Use <code>grep</code></strong> or tools like <code>esprima</code> to scan files for dangerous patterns.</li>
                  <li>Clear your cache and delete the project if anything looks shady.</li>
                  <li>If something feels off ‚Äî <strong>trust your gut</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>üì¢ Spread the Word</h2>
                <p>Freelancers and junior devs are often targeted for these ‚Äútest projects.‚Äù Don‚Äôt let curiosity or eagerness override caution.</p>
                <p>Share this. Help others avoid getting caught by these tactics.</p>

        "How I Simplified Node.js + TypeScript Setup with My First NPM Package",
      blogContent: `
    <p>Setting up a Node.js app with TypeScript had always been a repetitive task for me. Every time I started a new project, I found myself doing the same steps‚Äîconfiguring <code>tsconfig.json</code>, setting up <code>nodemon</code> or <code>ts-node-dev</code> for live reload, and managing folder structure.</p>
    <p>To save time, I decided to build a simple NPM package called <strong><code>add-node-ts</code></strong> that could automate this setup. With a single command, it bootstraps a ready-to-go Node.js project with TypeScript, complete with live restart on code changes.</p>
    <p>I published the package to NPM and kind of forgot about it. But when I checked the package page 3‚Äì4 days later, I was surprised to see it had <strong>90 weekly downloads</strong> later 100+. <br/> <img style="width: 300px; height: auto;" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrYU5UuakAAsxLw?format=png&name=900x900"/> <br/> It felt amazing to know that others found it useful too!</p>
    <p>Since then, the weekly downloads have stabilized to around <strong>20‚Äì25 downloads</strong>, but the experience taught me how impactful even a small utility can be for the developer community. It was also a huge motivation to continue building and sharing tools that solve real problems.</p>
    <p>If you're tired of repeating the same setup steps for every Node.js + TypeScript project, give <a style={fontWeight:"bold"} href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/add-node-ts">add-node-ts</a> a try!</p>
